# Developer Notes

- Plex playlist importer only works with m3u files
- Export from foobar2000 as m3u8 to preserve unicode characters
- Save to a new m3u file in Notepad++
- Convert the file to utf-8 in Notepad++ (Encoding -> Convert to UTF-8)
- Use those converted output files as the playlist import file.
